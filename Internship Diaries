# Internship-Diaries

*University of Twente*- Supervisor: dr Funda Yildirim

After my first Erasmus internship experience in Germany during my undergraduate degree, I had already decided that I wanted to do another Erasmus+ internship at least once more! With the desire and concern of creating a unique research question for my master’s thesis, I decided to work on an independent project that can contribute to both my research and career. 

When I noticed the CVNP Lab, which I have been following, moved to the Netherlands- University of Twente (UT), I contacted with dr Funda Yildirim without any hesitation. This was a great opportunity, because I’ve been following their studies since I was an undergraduate student. At UT, Dr. Funda Yildirim is working in a research group called [Cognition, Data, and Education (CODE)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/code/) which focuses on the studies of technology-based cognition and behavior.

In my e-mail, I basically mentioned my interests and my background and after that, we gathered to talk about what we could do together. These meetings were highly important because they gave me the exact information about what should I expect and what should I do when I get there. We also decided my research project topic and created our pathway in these meetings.

*Here is some information about my internship process:*

We are evaluating a high amount of information related our senses while we are shopping and packaging is one of them. The packaging material and characteristics such as texture, look, and even sound are critical cues for us as consumers. So, manipulating these features in the VR, and investigating the effects of them can contribute to developing sustainable choices in real life. To conclude up, we decided to work on a project that combines sensory processes and consumption behavior with the help of Virtual Reality.

While I was preparing my documents for Erasmus+ Traineeship Mobility, I was also looking for a place to stay. In Enschede, housing is kind of a problem. I reached lots of landlords, went through countless housing posts on Facebook, and recommended websites by UT.

    Enschede City Center

Being able to walk to the campus was one of my priorities, but living close to the city centre could also be so much fun. Because, when you came here, you are probably going to want to rent a bike, and with that you will be reaching everywhere. 

You can see some of my bike trip photos at the UT campus:

Also, using public transport is always a solid option, you can get detailed information from: [ns.nl.com](https://www.ns.nl/)

In UT, you’ll get the chance to thrive yourself in diverse ways. I attended departmental talks, student thesis defences, and some workshops. 

This is the Cubicus Building where Cognition, Data and Education (CODE) research group is located. Although you might easily get lost in this building, you'll love to work and study in here.

In the first month of my internship, I was working on the literature review about sensory perception with VR. We used [Covidence](https://https://www.covidence.org/) for the tracking of the articles that I read. Using a common tool that is reachable for every member of the project made much easier every step of the research (i.e. deciding to exclude or include articles). 

After deciding the parameters of our research, I worked on Unity to create VR environments. This was the most enjoyable part of my traineeship, especially when you worked in the VR Lab, which is equipped with VR headsets and devices- [ManouVR Lab.](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bmslab/infohub/xr-lab-specialty-and-best-practices/#using-the-xr-lab-and-their-equipment) This is a part of the BMS Lab, where you can run your experiments and collect data from your participants. Before starting working here, you should make a reservation with your project that you register before.

While I was dealing with Unity, I took some notes for my further studies. You can go through those notes at the end of this article. But, do not forget that they are just notes from the tutorial that I followed during my traineeship, they are not that comprehensive and advanced.

Working, interacting, and participating in an international working environment was a highly teaching experience for me. Talking and sharing your days, and your ideas with other members of the research group even during coffee breaks or lunches will be a memorable part of your learning and working experience. During these small talks, you'll find yourself thinking about moving and working in the Netherlands and pursuing your academic career here. 

On the other hand, there were lots of challenges that I faced some days other than feeling homesick. Trying to imitate real life in the VR environments could be challenging. Sometimes,  even grabbing a book just like how you are gripped in real life, can be considered as a victory.

Overall, an internship at UT and working on a sensory processes in a VR project greatly contributed to my understanding of Immersive Technologies. Now, I am aware of the fact that I can use VR environments for my studies in a wide range from psychological interventions to sensory experiments that include human experiences, and preferences.

Here, I'll shortly introduce what I learned in VR in the frame of sensory perception. 

In [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/), there are lots of tutorials about developing games and making games more pleasant for gamers. When it comes to interacting with VR, starting from the basics is the best thing to do. During my traineeship, I’ve watched lots of tutorials from lots of sources about the things that I struggle with, but following the one main tutorial makes it easier to learn about the basics.

[VR Development Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/welcome-to-the-pathway?pathwayId=627c12d8edbc2a75333b9185&missionId=62554983edbc2a76a27486cb#) is the main tutorial that I’ve followed. Here you’ll be starting from scratch, i.e. setting up the VR devices or getting familiar with the VR environment.

Following this tutorial can also be convenient in other ways. For example, as a beginner, I did not have to think of all the essential arrangements that require lots of time. The sample environment, which is the one you'll manipulate in the tutorial, already contains diverse assets and packs, which means  I could access all basic settings as default. 

As I progressed in the steps, I learned manipulating some sensory features. That was highly exciting for me! 

**Sensory Feedback:** 

You can easily add a haptic feedback component in the objects. That means, If you grap a object, your controllers will give you feedback-vibration. You can adjust the intensity of that vibration, and you can arrange some kind of delay for it. 

In some cases, in some experimental designs, you can also get feedback even when your controllers hover over the objects. In that way, you can make an arrangement for every object for its specific feedback, while hovering over them. 

Besides that, you can add auditory feedback on the objects that you interact with. While you can add reflection sounds coming from objects (crackling, popping, etc.), also you can add sound clips for television and mobile phones. At that point, I would like to mention a cool arrangement that you can try. Lets say you are near to the sound source (i.e fireplace) and one of your ears is closer to the sound source, you'll be hearing more sound of that ear. And, If you move away from that source, you'll be hearing less in every step. You can do this arrangement using the sound sphericity of the environment. 

Adding visual cues as a feedback are also one of your options. In the tutorial that I followed, I learned the turn on and off a remote controller, while seeing the red signal as a visual cue in the VR environment. I could change the color, intensity and size of that signal which can be manipulated according to the experimental design.

**Environmental Adjustments:**

In the virtual supermarket that I worked on the properties of the objects, I learned how to manipulate object's surfaces, color and brightness. At the shelf full of products, I changed the location and the packaging material of them. With that, I'll be able to use all the packaging material that I would like to use, and create and design all the packages according to my creativity and wish. This kind of flexibility is highly important for creating experimental designs, because researchers can elevate their both manipulatons and experiment settings. 

I hope this blog can be useful for anyone whose interested in doing an [ERASMUS internship](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/traineeships-abroad-for-students) at the [CNVP Lab](cnvplab.com) or whoever plans to start working with VR. 

Best!
